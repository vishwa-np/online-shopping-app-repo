Online shopping App is my first object-oriented java based demo project. This is an e-commerce application developed using Java, Spring framework, Hibernate, and MySQL technologies. Explore the robust features and functionalities crafted with industry-standard tools to enhance your understanding of building scalable and efficient e-commerce solutions.
In addition to developing the Online Shopping App as my first object-oriented Java project, I meticulously designed and managed MySQL databases for efficient data storage and retrieval within the application. Utilizing model/entity classes and controllers, I effectively mapped and managed client requests while ensuring seamless communication through REST APIs. Thorough testing of APIs using Postman was conducted to guarantee reliability. Moreover, I implemented repository and service layers to apply essential business logic, conducted comprehensive data validation, established role-based access, and diligently addressed and resolved any encountered bugs.
